As previously mentioned, the code files in a walkthru are pulled from a GitHub repo.

It's here in the config file that we specify the GitHub repo using the `owner` and `repo` properties.

You can use the `ref` property to specify a particular branch, tag, or commit. 

The `files` attribute allows you to specify which files from the repo should be included in your tutorial since you probably wouldn't need every single one.
