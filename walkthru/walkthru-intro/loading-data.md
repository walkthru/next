This is a static site which uses the Next.js framework. Next has a special method `getStaticProps` for loading data needed by the page at build time. 

This is the perfect place to compile and load the tutorial data. You can do this with the [WalkThru data module](https://github.com/walkthru/data).

To load the data, you'll need the *tutorial slug* and a *GitHub Personal Access Token*.
