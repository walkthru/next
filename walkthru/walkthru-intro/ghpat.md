Since WalkThru gets code from GitHub using its API, you'll need a *GitHub Personal Access Token*.

These can be generated for free - instructions are [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

It's a good idea to store this in an environment variable.
