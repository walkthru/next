To make it easier to explain your code, you can focus on specific lines of a code file.

To do this, set the `focus` property in the frontmatter and indicate the range of lines to focus on. 

You can also specify the `center` property which indicates which line should be in the center of the page when the step loads. (This is useful in large code files as you'll see in a moment).
