A tutorial created with Walkthru is called a *walkthru* (with a small "w"). 

The steps of a walkthru include text instructions (displayed here on the left side) and a code file (displayed on the right side).

Steps are defined in markdown files. In fact, the code file you're viewing is the markdown file used to define this step! 🤯
